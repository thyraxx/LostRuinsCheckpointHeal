# LostRuinsMod
This is a mod which adds a restoring HP and MP when touching a checkpoint. Currently the player isn't notified except for the fact its HP and MP is restored.
If there is demand I could still enable the 'effects' you see when an checkpoint is touched. IIRC you see green particles as such.

**Warning**: Playing this mod might unlock achievements, or have other side effects which aren't accountable for.

## Prerequisite
- BepInEx v5.x.x x86

## Install
Extract [BepInEx 5 x86](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) into the the LostRuins folder where the LostRuins.exe is located.

**e.g**: (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\LostRuins)  
Download and drop the dll you can download [here](https://github.com/thyraxx/LostRuinsMod/releases/latest) into **/BepInEx/plugins** folder.
If the **plugins** folder doesn't exist yet, you could start the game first with only BepInEx, it should create it. 
**OR**
Immediately create the folder yourself and place the mod into the plugins folder, should also work.
